Terraform has got two main components
config file (tf) and state provides input to Core. Based on the inputs, Core derives an execution plan and executes it. 
A basic terraform script will have below format

   <block> <parameters> {
        key1=value1
        key2=value2
    }
 Eg :- 
 
    resource "local_file" "pet" {
         filename = "/root/pet.txt"
         content = "we love pets"
    }
  terraform init -> terraform plan -> terraform apply
